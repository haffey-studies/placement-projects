They hypothesised that reduced neural pruning causes activation in the V4 area in response to graphemes/words.\n\",15px,\r\n\"Disinhibited feedback theory \",\"(Grossenbacher and Lovelace, 2001)\n\nThere is stronger feedback from higher-level cortical regions in synaesthetes even though they do have normal connectivity patterns. Suggests that the activation of colour in the brain occurs after the processing of graphemes.\nThese cortical regions control language, vision, recognising objects and awareness.\n\",15px,\r\nGrapheme/colour synaethesia,The activation of colour (in the brain) when seeing letters. This is the most common type of synaesthesia,15px,\r\n\"Sound/colour synaesthesia \",\"The activation of colour (in the brain) when hearing different sounds and noises. There is commonly a link between pitch and lightness (with lightness increasing as pitch does).\nSound-colour synaesthetes demonstrate increased activity in the left inferior parietal cortex. \",15px,\r\nLexical /gustatory synaesthesia,\"Lexical-gustatory synesthesia causes an experience to an automatic and highly consistent taste or smell. These tastes are evoked by an inducer which stimulates the sensation and activates the taste experience concurrently (Ward, 2007)\",15px,\r\n\"Mirror/ touch synarsthesia \",\"Experiencing the same physical sensations as someone else (in the same part or opposite part of the body). This type of synaesthesia has been associated with increased empathy (Banissy & Ward, 2007) and increased emotion discrimination (Banissy et al., 2011)\",15px,\r\nSynaesthetic heritability,\"\nFound to run in families. (Baron-Cohen et al, 1996)\nIn monozygotic twins, only one of them were found to have it (so not 100% concordance between monozygotic twins). Also found to skip generations.\nAffects up to 1 in 23 people (Simner et al., 2006)\",15px,\r\nSequence-space synaesthesia,\"A form of synaesthesia in which ordinal sequences such as letters of the alphabet or months of the year are perceived to occupy spatial locations in the mind’s eye. As a variety of visuospatial mental imagery, these individual may reflect known fractionation of imagery processes (Price and Mentzani, 2008)\",15px,\r\nAuditory-tactile synaesthesia,\"A type of synaesthesia where sound induces physical sensation, which may be perceived in specific parts of the body. Can be accquired from early age, however is a long process of correlating both auditory and sensory tactile inputs with meaningful interpretations (Winawer, 2013)\",15px,\r\n,,,"
